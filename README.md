# Knight's movements
Just my research into generalizing how a chess knight moves, or, rather, any other configuration of movements (x,y) with knight-like symmetry on an infinite board.
TODO: write more here lol

**Update:** found the solution on math stackexchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3249487/can-an-a-b-knight-reach-every-point-on-a-chessboard. Will rework the code to suit it.

## How to run
`cargo run`
(shocking, right?!)
